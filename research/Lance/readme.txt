absolute barebones and barely working use of swarm but using ollama llm instead of openai.

some responses I got were complete nonsense but I need to test more.

Will update later with how to run this because I can only get it to work in annoconda not vscode, just don't have time now!
(ask me directly in case if forget lol)

I think this is a good start to build agents on top of swarm + ollama.
