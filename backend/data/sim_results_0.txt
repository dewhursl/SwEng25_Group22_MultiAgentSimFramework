It's indeed a popular model due to its efficiency and long-standing reliability.

Based on that, I can approve a fitting discount or promotion that aligns with your budget goals. Let’s work together on making this a valuable purchase for you!", type='TextMessage'),

Special financing rates are a fantastic way to manage a new car purchase comfortably, and we’ll focus on securing the best possible terms for you. Let me gather some more details and see if there’s anything else we can leverage for your benefit:\n\n1. **Credit Score Information**: Generally, better financing rates are available to those with a strong credit history. It will help us understand the rates you qualify for.\n\n2. **Down Payment**: Higher down payments can sometimes unlock better interest rates, reducing the overall cost of the car over time.\n\n3. **Term Length**: We can look at different financing term lengths to find a balance that fits your monthly budget.\n\nOnce we have your credit score, down payment preference, and the term length in mind, we can have a conversation with Toyota Financial Services to hone in on the best rate available specifically for you. I’ll help you navigate this smoothly, to ensure we meet, and perhaps exceed, your budget goals comfortably. Let me know if you’d like to discuss any of these aspects further or arrange for a test drive while we finalize the financial details!', type='TextMessage'),
