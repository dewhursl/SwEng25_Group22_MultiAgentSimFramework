I’m particularly interested in the Toyota Camry and the Honda Accord. Could you tell me about the current promotions or discounts you have available for these models? Additionally, I’d like to know about the mileage for these vehicles. Since I'm working with a specific budget in mind, any little bit of savings helps, and the mileage is quite important to me as well.", type='TextMessage'), 
TextMessage(source='CarSalesman', models_usage=RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=515, completion_tokens=253), content="Fantastic choices! Both the Toyota Camry and the Honda Accord are excellent vehicles, known for their reliability and efficiency. Here's a bit more information on each:\n\n**Toyota Camry:**\n- **Mileage:** The Camry typically offers around 28-39 MPG, depending on the specific model and whether you opt for the hybrid version, which tends to offer higher efficiency.\n- **Current Promotions:** We're offering special financing rates and lease deals this month, which can significantly reduce your monthly payments. \n\n**Honda Accord:**\n- **Mileage:** The Accord usually delivers between 30-38 MPG, making it a strong performer in terms of fuel economy. The hybrid model is even more efficient if you're interested in that option.\n- **Current Promotions:** Similar to the Camry, we have attractive financing packages on the Accord, as well as bonus cash offers on select models.\n\nWhile I can't specify the exact discount without manager approval, these promotions can provide some attractive savings or financing conditions.\n\nI understand budget considerations are important. If you let me know what budget you have in mind, we can work together to ensure that one of these options is a perfect fit for your needs. Also, you might want to consider a test drive to see which feels best for you.", type='TextMessage'), 
TextMessage(source='Customer', models_usage=RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=789, completion_tokens=126), content="Thank you for the information! The mileage on both the Camry and the Accord sounds perfect. I’m keen on exploring any potential savings, so could you share more about any waivers or cash rebates that might be available? I understand you might not be able to give an exact amount right now, but I’d appreciate whatever details you can provide. In terms of budget, I'll share that I’m looking for the best deal possible. Could we explore the pricing starting from the lowest possible point, factoring in any of the promotions or discounts you mentioned? I’m open to considering leasing if it offers a more favorable financial arrangement.", type='TextMessage'), 
TextMessage(source='Manager', models_usage=RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=877, completion_tokens=348), content="I'm glad the mileage is to your liking. Let's explore those saving options a bit more:\n\n**Toyota Camry:**\n- **Cash Rebates & Incentives:** The manufacturer is currently offering a rebate program that can lower the purchase price. Additionally, there are loyalty or conquest rebates available if you're trading in a current vehicle or switching brands, respectively.\n- **Lease Offers:** We have very competitive lease offers with low monthly payments, often starting at an attractive baseline for a well-equipped model. The leasing terms may allow you a lower upfront cost compared to buying outright.\n\n**Honda Accord:**\n- **Cash Rebates & Incentives:** Similar rebate options might be available for the Accord. These include cash rebates on select models and possible bonuses for previous Honda owners or those switching from other brands.\n- **Lease Offers:** The Accord also comes with appealing lease deals, often matched with end-of-year incentives, which could make it an excellent option financially.\n\nI suggest we sit down to discuss your specific financial goals in detail. This way, we can align the pricing to meet your budget, making sure you're getting the best deal possible utilizing all the available promotions. Leasing indeed might be the more favorable arrangement if you're aiming for lower payments and intending to switch vehicles in a few years. It also often means less maintenance responsibility.\n\nI can certainly work with you to find the ideal scenario that fits your budget while leveraging these promotions. Once we've narrowed down exactly what you're looking for, I can take the details to my manager and potentially secure an even better offer tailored to your needs. Would you like to set up a time to visit the dealership, perhaps for a test drive, or is there any other information I can provide to help in your decision-making?", type='TextMessage'),
