We have a fantastic selection, but let me tell you about a particular gem: the 2023 Toyota Camry. It's known for its reliability, excellent fuel efficiency, and comfortable ride, making it perfect for both city driving and longer trips.\n\nThe model we have comes with a variety of features including a spacious interior, advanced safety technology, and a sleek design that suits any style. Plus, the mileage on this beauty is extremely competitive for its class.\n\nWhile I can't promise upfront discounts due to our current pricing structure, I assure you, this model is a great value for its price. Once you fall in love with this car, we can discuss it further and I'll see what I can do with our manager in terms of incentives. Would you like to take it for a test drive or learn more about its specific features?", type='TextMessage'),

TextMessage(source='CarSalesman', models_usage=RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=398, completion_tokens=167), content="The 2023 Toyota Camry is an excellent choice, and I'm excited that you're considering it! This model typically comes with a fuel efficiency of around 28 mpg in the city and 39 mpg on the highway, making it one of the more economical options for fuel costs over time.\n\nAs for the asking price, the Camry we have is priced at $29,995. It's packed with features like adaptive cruise control, a user-friendly infotainment system, and a comprehensive warranty, which contribute to its great value.\n\nRegarding negotiation, while I can't guarantee specific discounts myself, I can certainly bring any reasonable offers you have to our manager for consideration. My goal is to ensure you're completely satisfied with your purchase while staying within your budget. What do you think? Would you be interested in taking a closer look at this vehicle?", type='TextMessage'),

Let me talk to our manager and see if there's any possibility for flexibility with the pricing. Generally, our prices are set to be competitive based on the current market, but I’ll do my best to see what options we might have available for you, such as potential financing plans or manufacturer incentives that might ease the financial consideration.\n\nIf you could provide me with a specific target in mind, I can take that to the manager with a stronger case for a price adjustment. We strive to work within customers' budgets and ensure you drive away happy. Let me see what I can arrange and I’ll get back to you shortly. Would an adjustment of around 5% make the car more appealing to you, or do you have another figure in mind?", type='TextMessage'),

I will present your offer to my manager and see what we can work out in terms of pricing. A $5,000 adjustment is quite substantial, but I'll advocate on your behalf and see if there are any creative solutions like financing benefits or manufacturer promotions to help close that gap.\n\nI'll discuss it with them and get back to you as soon as possible with their feedback. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to make this work for you—you’re in good hands. Please hang tight for just a moment!", type='TextMessage'), 
TextMessage(source='Manager', models_usage=RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=957, completion_tokens=149), content="After discussing with the manager, we appreciate your interest in the Toyota Camry and can certainly explore some options to make it more budget-friendly for you. While a direct $5,000 discount on the Camry itself might be beyond our standard parameters due to current inventory costs, what I can offer is a combination of potential manufacturer rebates and special financing options that might reduce your initial payments or offer some savings that could effectively match your target across the life of your financing plan.\n\nAlternatively, we may have certified pre-owned models or different trim options, possibly an earlier model year, that could offer similar features at a substantially lower price point. Let me know how you'd like to proceed, and I'll do everything possible to ensure you're happy with your purchase.", type='TextMessage'),

TextMessage(source='CarSalesman', models_usage=RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=1244, completion_tokens=181), content="Absolutely! Let's explore these options to ensure you get the best deal within your budget. For the Toyota Camry, we often have certified pre-owned models, usually a year or two old, that have gone through rigorous checks and come with extended warranties. This option often provides a fantastic balance of cost savings and peace of mind, with the potential savings bringing the cost significantly down.\n\nRegarding financing, we have flexible plans that could lower your monthly payments, and if a rebate is available, it may effectively reduce the total financial impact as well. \n\nI'd be happy to show you some of the certified pre-owned Camrys we have on the lot, along with different trims or model years that could match your wish list and budget. What do you say to setting up a time to visit and explore these options in person? We can then take a closer look at the numbers together and tailor them to your needs.", type='TextMessage'),
