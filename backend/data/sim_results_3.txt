Could you tell me more about what you have available? I'm interested in the make and model details too. Additionally, are there any discounts or special offers I should know about?", type='TextMessage'), 
TextMessage(source='CarSalesman', models_usage=RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=459, completion_tokens=284), content="Hello! I'd be happy to help you find a car that fits your needs. We have a variety of options that offer great value for money, along with some fantastic features. Could you let me know if you're looking for a particular make or model, or are you open to different options?\n\nAs for mileage, we have several models with low mileage that are popular right now. For instance, we have a few sedans and SUVs that are both reliable and affordable. Let me give you more details about a couple of popular options:\n\n1. **Sedan A**: This model is known for its fuel efficiency and smooth ride. It comes with advanced safety features and a modern infotainment system. It's perfect for city driving and long trips alike.\n\n2. **SUV B**: If you need a bit more space and versatility, this SUV offers a comfortable ride with a powerful engine and ample cargo space. It's designed for both urban and off-road environments.\n\nRegarding discounts and special offers, we do have financing options that make owning a new car more affordable. We sometimes run promotions or special financing terms, especially on certain models. However, I'd need to check with my manager about any specific current offers or discounts, as they vary.\n\nLet's arrange a time for you to come in, take a look, and perhaps test drive a few of these options. I'm confident we can find something that meets your needs and budget!", type='TextMessage'),

I'm open to options, but could you let me know what the specific prices for the Sedan A and SUV B are? I'm particularly interested in how they compare in terms of affordability. Also, what kind of mileage are we looking at for these cars? It would also be really helpful if you could check with your manager about any current promotions or discounts available on these models.", type='TextMessage'), 
TextMessage(source='CarSalesman', models_usage=RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=840, completion_tokens=259), content="Absolutely, I can provide you with more details on both options.\n\n- **Sedan A**: This model is competitively priced at around $25,000. It offers great fuel economy with low mileage, averaging about 30,000 miles. It's an excellent choice if you're looking for affordability without compromising on the essentials.\n\n- **SUV B**: Priced at approximately $32,000, this SUV offers more space and power. It currently has around 35,000 miles on it, which is excellent for an SUV. It's ideal if you need the flexibility of more cargo space or plan on taking longer trips.\n\nIn terms of affordability, the Sedan A may be better if upfront cost is a primary concern, but SUV B gives more versatility if you have a bit more room in your budget for the added features and space.\n\nRegarding promotions, I will definitely check in with my manager to see if any specific discounts are available for these models. We occasionally have promotional financing rates or special offers that could benefit you, so I'll ensure to find out the most current details for you.\n\nIn the meantime, if you’re available, I’d love to set up a time for you to come by for a test drive.

I've just had a word with the manager, and here's what we can offer:\n\n- **Sedan A Discount**: We can offer a $500 discount on Sedan A, bringing the price down to $24,500. This is in addition to any financing options you choose.\n\n- **SUV B Discount**: For the SUV B, we're currently offering a $750 discount for a final price of $31,250, which is a real bargain for this vehicle class.\n\nBoth vehicles also qualify for our special financing promotion, which might offer you lower interest rates depending on your credit approval.\n\nI’d recommend taking the opportunity to visit us soon as these offers are subject to vehicle availability.

It's great to hear there's a discount on the Sedan A. Bringing the price down to $24,500 makes it quite appealing given the mileage and features. I'm definitely interested in it.\n\nHowever, I was hoping you could offer a bit more flexibility on the price. Do you think there's any way we could adjust it a bit further, maybe another few hundred dollars off? If we can settle on, say, $24,000, it would make it a much easier decision for me.\n\nI'd be able to come by for a test drive and potentially finalize everything if we can make that adjustment.
