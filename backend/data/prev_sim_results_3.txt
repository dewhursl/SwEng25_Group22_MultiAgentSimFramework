Could you show me some options that are affordable and have low mileage? I'm particularly interested in getting a good deal and possibly a discount if available. What make and models do you have that fit these criteria?", type='TextMessage'),

We have a fantastic selection of vehicles with low mileage and great features. Let's take a look at some options that are both affordable and still have all the perks you're looking for.\n\n1. **Toyota Camry** - Known for reliability and efficiency, the Camry is a fantastic choice. We have several in stock with under 25,000 miles. They're well-equipped with features like a rearview camera and Bluetooth connectivity.\n\n2. **Honda Civic** - Another great option, especially if you're looking for something practical yet stylish. The Civics we have come with low mileage and offer modern tech features along with great fuel efficiency.\n\n3. **Ford Escape** - If you're considering an SUV with spacious interior and good mileage, the Ford Escape is perfect. It provides comfort and utility without compromising on performance.\n\nWe price our vehicles very competitively, and if you're interested in any of these cars, I can certainly check with our manager to see if there's any flexibility in the price or if there are any current promotions or rebates. Why don't we take a look at one of these cars and you can have a feel for it on a test drive? That way, you can see which one fits you best!", type='TextMessage'), 
TextMessage(source='Customer', models_usage=RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=432, completion_tokens=71), content="Thank you for the information! The Toyota Camry and Honda Civic both sound interesting, but I'd like to know what price range we are looking at for these models with low mileage. Also, are there any current promotions like rebates or special financing that could bring the cost down? If you've got a discounted price upfront, that would definitely help my decision.", type='TextMessage'), 
TextMessage(source='CarSalesman', models_usage=RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=494, completion_tokens=254), content="Absolutely, let's break it down for you! \n\nFor the **Toyota Camry**, our models with low mileage are priced competitively around the mid $20,000s, though it depends on the year and specific features included. It offers exceptional value considering its reliability and longevity. \n\nThe **Honda Civic** models typically fall in a similar price range, depending on the trim level and added features. Generally, you can expect these to be around $20,000 to $23,000. \n\nRegarding promotions, we currently offer attractive financing options for qualified buyers, such as low-interest rates that can make your monthly payments more manageable. As for rebates, they can vary, but I can certainly check with our manager to see if there are any applicable promotions for you today.\n\nI understand you're looking for a great deal without any surprises. I’m here to assist you every step of the way, and I’ll do my very best to help find you a vehicle that fits your budget and needs. Let’s set up a time for you to visit, perhaps even today if you’re free, to explore these cars with a test drive. This way, I can give you a more personalized experience and check any available promotions directly with my manager. Does that sound good?", type='TextMessage'), 
TextMessage(source='Customer', models_usage=RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=769, completion_tokens=83), content="That sounds great! I appreciate you checking on any available promotions as well. If you could try and see if we could work on the price to bring it closer to $20,000, especially for the Camry, I'd be very interested in coming in for a test drive today. Let me know what you can do, and I'll be eager to come over and possibly drive away in one of those cars!", type='TextMessage'), 
TextMessage(source='Manager', models_usage=RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=814, completion_tokens=209), content="I'm glad to hear you're interested! Let me review the options for the Toyota Camry. If we're looking at bringing the price closer to $20,000, I'll need to consider a few factors, like the specific model year, trim, and the features it includes. Generally, bringing down the price significantly would typically be tough without considering trade-in options or financing promotions.\n\nWhat I can do is review any manufacturer rebates or dealership incentives that might apply and potentially discuss a trade-in if you have a vehicle you're considering trading. Additionally, if you’re flexible with the model year or trim, we might have some that can better fit your target price.\n\nLet me have a quick conversation with my team and see what we might be able to arrange for you. I will do my best to ensure you get a deal that works! Please feel free to come by the dealership today, so we can provide a test drive experience, and I can update you in person with all available options and savings. Is there a particular time that works for you today?", type='TextMessage'), 
TextMessage(source='Customer', models_usage=RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=1071, completion_tokens=85), content="Thank you, I really appreciate you checking those options and considering ways to work with my budget. I am definitely interested in discussing trade-ins or reviewing any specific rebates or incentives. \n\nI can stop by the dealership later today. How about late afternoon, around 3 PM? That should give us enough time for a test drive and to go over the details. I'm looking forward to seeing what we can work out together!", type='TextMessage'),
