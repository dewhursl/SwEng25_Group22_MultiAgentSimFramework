How does that sound?", type='TextMessage'),

The Honda Accord LX we discussed is still within that price range of about $28,000, and of course, since this is a new model, it would have 0 kilometers on the odometer. \n\nRegarding price adjustments, my manager indicated that while we adhere closely to our pricing structures, there may still be some flexibility, particularly in terms of special financing offers that could lower the overall cost of ownership. \n\nFinancing through our dealership can also open up some possibilities for reducing immediate out-of-pocket expenses, which is another way to make the car fit into your budget more comfortably.\n\nHow about we take that test drive now to ensure the Accord meets all your expectations?
