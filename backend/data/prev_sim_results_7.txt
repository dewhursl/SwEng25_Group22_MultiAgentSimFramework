I don't have a specific make or model in mind, but I am interested in both sedans and SUVs, preferably something known for reliability and a good balance of performance and fuel efficiency.\n\nI'm open to both new and pre-owned vehicles, but for pre-owned, I would want to make sure they have reasonable mileage, definitely nothing too high. Something with low miles would be ideal, especially if it's a few years old.\n\nRegarding discounts and deals, I'm very interested in what kind of incentives you have, particularly on the models I'm considering. I understand there might be some wiggle room in the pricing, especially for pre-owned vehicles, so I'd appreciate any flexibility there.\n\nCould you share some specific options that might be a near-perfect fit for what I'm looking for?
