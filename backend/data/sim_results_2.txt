The pricing for a new Honda Civic typically starts around $23,000 and can go up depending on the trim level and any additional features or packages you choose. \n\nAs for promotions, we do have some flexible financing options and competitive rates available right now. While I can't guarantee a specific discount without approval from my manager, I'd be happy to work with you to see if we can find something that fits within your budget. \n\nWould you like to discuss any particular trims or features so I can provide you with a more detailed quote?

TextMessage(source='Manager', models_usage=RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=574, completion_tokens=134), content="Great choice with the base model! Let me gather some details to help us arrive at a potential discount. Typically, with new cars like the Honda Civic, negotiation is more about finding available manufacturer incentives or dealer specials. As your manager, I’ll authorize a reasonable discount, considering factors like competition, supply, and demand.\n\nFor a new Honda Civic, you would generally find delivery mileage only, likely less than 50 miles as it’s simply due to its transport and dealer handling.\n\nNow, allow me to confirm intricate details and see if there are current incentives or if there's any flexibility with additional accessories. I’ll get back to you with the best possible offer shortly!", type='TextMessage'),
