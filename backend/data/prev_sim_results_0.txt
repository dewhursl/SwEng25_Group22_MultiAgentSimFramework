TextMessage(source='Customer', models_usage=RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=87, completion_tokens=78), content="Hi there! I'm interested in buying a car, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. Could you tell me more about the different options you have available right now, preferably with low mileage? Also, are there any current promotions or discounts that I might be able to take advantage of? And could you provide me with details about the make and model of the cars as well?", type='TextMessage'), 
TextMessage(source='CarSalesman', models_usage=RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=156, completion_tokens=318), content="Hello! I'm glad you're considering a new car, and I'd be more than happy to help you find the perfect vehicle within your budget. Let's explore some great options together.\n\nFirst, we have a range of vehicles with low mileage, including compact cars, sedans, and SUVs, from popular brands like Toyota, Honda, and Ford. Here are a few options we currently have in stock:\n\n1. **Toyota Corolla** - Known for its reliability and fuel efficiency. This model comes with a modern infotainment system and advanced safety features, making it a great all-around vehicle.\n\n2. **Honda Civic** - A stylish sedan that offers a smooth and comfortable ride. Its compact design makes it perfect for city driving, and it also comes equipped with the latest tech features.\n\n3. **Ford Escape** - This is a spacious and versatile SUV, perfect for families or anyone needing extra cargo space. It has a strong reputation for safety and includes plenty of comfort features.\n\nAs for promotions, we occasionally run promotions that may apply. However, any current discounts or promotions would need to be discussed specifically for each vehicle, and I'd be happy to assist you further in identifying any possibilities that might apply to the car you're interested in.\n\nLet's schedule a time for you to test drive a few models and discuss specific pricing options to stay within your budget. You can always make an offer, and if need be, I can present this to my manager for potential approval.\n\nFeel free to let me know if you have any specific preferences or requirements, so I can assist you further in finding a perfect match.", type='TextMessage'), 
TextMessage(source='Customer', models_usage=RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=495, completion_tokens=79), content="Great, those options sound promising! I'm particularly interested in the Toyota Corolla and the Honda Civic, as I've heard good things about their reliability. Could you give me an idea of the price and mileage on these cars? Also, are there any specific discounts or deals available on either of them at the moment? I'd like to see how close we can get to a price that's comfortable for me.", type='TextMessage'), 
TextMessage(source='CarSalesman', models_usage=RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=565, completion_tokens=285), content="Absolutely, the Toyota Corolla and Honda Civic are both excellent choices known for their reliability and overall value. Let's take a look at what we have:\n\n1. **Toyota Corolla:**\n   - **Price Range:** Starting around $22,000 (depending on the specific model, trim, and any additional features you choose).\n   - **Mileage:** We have options with as low as 5,000 to 15,000 miles.\n\n2. **Honda Civic:**\n   - **Price Range:** Starting around $21,000, with some variations based on trim and extras.\n   - **Mileage:** Similar to the Corolla, expect models in the range of 8,000 to 18,000 miles.\n\nRegarding discounts or special offers, we typically have manufacturer incentives and financing deals that might apply. While I can't guarantee a specific discount upfront, we always aim to provide the best possible deal for our customers. Once we narrow down the exact model and trim you are interested in, I can also consult with my manager to see if there's flexibility on the pricing.\n\nI suggest we set up an appointment for you to come by, take a look at both models, and have a test drive. This way, we can assess which option fits your needs best, and I can put forward a proposal for consideration.\n\nLet me know if there’s a particular day and time that works for you, and we’ll get started!", type='TextMessage'), 
TextMessage(source='Customer', models_usage=RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=871, completion_tokens=92), content="Those prices seem like a good starting point. Before scheduling a visit, could we try to look a bit more into potential promotional financing or any specific offers that might be able to lower the price? I just want to make sure we're as close as possible to a figure that works for me before heading over. And if there's any wiggle room, especially with those mileage points, on something a bit more favorable, that would be fantastic to know in advance!", type='TextMessage'), 
TextMessage(source='CarSalesman', models_usage=RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=954, completion_tokens=313), content='Absolutely, I understand the importance of getting a figure that meets your expectations before you make the trip. Here’s how we can move forward:\n\n1. **Promotional Financing:** Often, manufacturers offer low APR financing or even zero-percent APR for qualifying buyers on select models. Availability can depend on credit approval and the specific model in question. I can gather detailed information on current financing promotions for both the Toyota Corolla and Honda Civic.\n\n2. **Incentives and Offers:** There might be specific offers like cashback deals or loyalty bonuses depending on your situation (e.g., current ownership of one of the brands, or if you or a family member is in the military). Once I have more details about your specific interests and setup, I can check available incentives.\n\n3. **Discussing Mileage and Pricing Flexibility:** Based on your budget requirements and interest in low mileage, I can provide options that balance both – sometimes, a vehicle with slightly higher mileage might offer more room for pricing adjustment, or there might be room to discuss certified pre-owned vehicles with additional incentives.\n\nI will check with our finance team and speak with my manager to get a clearer overview of what we can offer specifically. If you can provide any additional information or specifics, like credit score range or possible trade-ins, that would further help me tailor the best offer for you.\n\nAdditionally, if you’d like, I can reach out with the best possible figures on these vehicles later today or tomorrow. Let me know how you’d like to proceed, and we’ll ensure to maximize the value for you.', type='TextMessage'),
